Hello

This repo is to document all the content from the course of Patrick Collins under Cyfrin-Updraft.

I should have done this with Alchemy in the beginning but since all the coding was in their web GUI it was not so needed.
I did in the end.

Back to this repo. As much as possible will I add comment lines to explain what is being done. 
It might sound novice, it is, as I am trying to complete the novice level.

Things like mappings and structs might seem logic for advanced users. For beginners I feel it does help to everytime explain what 
the mapping or struct does for example.
